# Ignition Challenge

## Introduction
The current codebase is bad. There is no real structure to it, no semantics and it reeks bad practice. Additionally, the final result is fairly bland. Apart from the code enhancements, we would like to see a little bit of creativity. How would you make this site stand out?

At Ignition we use a range of tools/languages to help us complete tasks efficiently while remaining well managed. We use tools like CoffeeScript, Stylus, Brunch, Grunt, LESS/SASS and many more. Use tools that you feel are fit to provide you with a better code base, but don't feel that they are necessary as tools should be used to aid and they shouldn't hinder your progress. Below is a brief of what we would like, you can apply the tools to suitably create the better codebase.

## What we would like to see
**General**
- The gallery should be three columns wide.
- Make sure alignment is consistent and elements are crisp (pixel perfect).
- The readmore buttons currently don't work; make the additional text animate in.
- Code should be legible and suitable as a medium/large-scale project.

**HTML**
- Change the code to make it semantic.
- Templating is encouraged if it increases readability.

**CSS**
- Ideally use a preprocessor (LESS/SASS/Stylus...) and give better structure to the code.
- Fix whatever you think needs fixing to make the code perform well while being schematic.

**JS**
- Use any language that encourages better code. TypeScript/CoffeeScript or similar languages may be used at your discretion.
- Write a lightbox/popup to show the full size of the thumbnails on click. The full-sized images are already included (/images/gallery folder).

## Bonus points
- Make the site responsive, while retaining all content.
- Use a HTML build tool (Grunt, brunch or any others) to structure the site.

## Finally
You can be as creative as you like. Thank you for taking the time to take this challenge. Good luck! If you have any questions feel free to ask, it is encouraged!
